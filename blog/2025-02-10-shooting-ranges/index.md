No state statute or regulation addresses the use of high-powered firearms on private shooting ranges. Shooting ranges are generally regulated by towns, and there are very few state laws pertaining to them.

Would you want to live in a war zone like this? Anyone in nearly the entire state of Connecticut can do this! With no minimum size requirement shooters can just load, point, and shoot. There is no need to have a properly constructed backstop; nor are there any laws that criminalize the shooter for sending their rounds onto abutting properties or subjecting their neighbors to hours of this kind of noise. This madness has to stop before someone is hurt or killed.
