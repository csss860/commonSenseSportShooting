No state statute or regulation addresses the use of high-powered firearms on private shooting ranges. Shooting ranges are generally regulated by towns, and there are very few state laws pertaining to them.

Would you want to live in a war zone? In Connecticut, anyone can create one. With no minimum lot size requirement, shooters can load, aim, and fire—regardless of how close their neighbors are, whether a public hiking trail or nature preserve is nearby, or even if a school is just down the road. It doesn’t matter. Just spray and pray, hoping no one is injured or killed.

There’s no requirement for a properly constructed backstop. No laws hold shooters accountable for sending rounds onto neighboring properties or subjecting entire communities to hours of relentless gunfire.

This reckless disregard for public safety must end—before someone is hurt or killed.
