Here is a clip, about twelve seconds long of the neighbor across the street from my home shooting a semi-automatic weapon (likely an AR-15) with a high capacity magazine. While this clip is only twelve seconds long they were shooting for nine hours. This was one of fourteen shooting ranges on my street. Oftentimes there would be numerous neighbors shooting at the same time to the north, south, east, and west of our home. One of our neighbors was using our land as the impact area for his shooting range. Several neighbors were shooting towards hiking trails on a nature preserve that our properties abutted. Our house was struck by a bullet, less than ten feet from our dining room table and less than twenty five feet from two 120 gallon propane tanks.

Take a moment to watch this video and ask yourself if you would want to live in a neighborhood where this is a regular occurrence.
