The only law currently in Connecticut that can loosely interpreted to regulate the act of target shooting was written to regulate hunting. The [current law](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2016/rpt/pdf/2016-R-0196.pdf) states that: "The regulation generally prohibit anyone from hunting with firearms, discharging firearms, or carrying loaded firearms within 500 feet of a building occupied by people or domestic animals or used to store flammable or combustible material [unless you have written permission]"

Does this sound like a viable law to regulate the activity of target shooting?

A hunter may discharge only a handful of rounds during an entire day while engaged in the activity of harvesting wildlife. A hunter is only taking well aimed shots with the intent of killing their prey in one shot. Target shooters on the other hand could discharge thousands upon thousands of rounds in an afternoon. Depending on the caliber of their ammunition the bullet can travel over two miles.

So, where are their rounds going? What is stopping those rounds? Is their a chance the bullet could ricochet? Could someone unwittingly wander into their impact area? Should children who are at school playing during recess, be subjected to listening to gunfire that is just barely over 500' from their playground?

These questions are too important to just be left to chance. The state of Connecticut needs to regulate the hobby of backyard target shooting ranges before it is too late.
